## ðŸŒŸ What is `uv` in Python?

**`uv`** is a **blazing-fast Python package and project manager**, written in Rust. It's designed to **replace and unify** tools like:

* `pip` â€“ for installing packages
* `pip-tools` â€“ for dependency resolution
* `pipx` â€“ for running standalone scripts
* `virtualenv` â€“ for creating virtual environments
* `pyenv` â€“ for managing Python versions
* `poetry` / `hatch` â€“ for project management

It is built by [Astral](https://astral.sh), and it dramatically speeds up Python workflows.
