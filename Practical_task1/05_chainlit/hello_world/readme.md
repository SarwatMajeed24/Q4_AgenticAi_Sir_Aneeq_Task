# 🤖 My Chainlit Chatbot

This project is built using [Chainlit](https://www.chainlit.io/), a Python framework for rapidly building and sharing LLM-based chat applications.

## 📌 Features

- Chat interface powered by a Large Language Model (LLM)
- Custom tools and logic integrated with the chatbot
- Real-time interaction and debugging UI
- Easily shareable and deployable

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-chatbot.git
cd your-chatbot
````

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

```
chainlit
openai  # or other LLM provider
```

### Run the App

```bash
chainlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server and open a browser window with your chatbot.

## 📄 Example `app.py`

```python
import chainlit as cl
from openai import OpenAI

@cl.on_message
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    response = f"You said: {message.content}"
    await cl.Message(content=response).send()
```

## 📤 Deployment

To deploy your Chainlit app, you can use:

* Chainlit Cloud (coming soon or via self-hosting)
* Streamlit Sharing, Vercel (for frontend), or Docker + FastAPI backend

## 🧠 LLM Integration

To use OpenAI (or other models), integrate it inside your `main()` like this:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

def get_response(prompt):
    return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

Then send the result back to Chainlit.
